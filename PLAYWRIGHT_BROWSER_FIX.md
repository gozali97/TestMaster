# Playwright Browser Visibility and Lifecycle Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Browser Not Appearing** ✅
- **Problem**: Browser was running in headless mode (`headless: true`)
- **Solution**: Changed to `headless: false` in controller
- **Result**: Browser window will now be visible during testing

### 2. **"Target page, context or browser has been closed" Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: Browser/pages were being closed while operations were still running
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `page.isClosed()` checks before all page operations
  - Improved cleanup logic with proper error handling
  - Added detailed logging to track lifecycle events

### 3. **Resource Overload** ✅
- **Problem**: Too many parallel workers (5) causing browser crashes
- **Solution**: Reduced to 3 parallel workers
- **Result**: More stable execution with less memory/CPU usage

### 4. **Poor Error Visibility** ✅
- **Problem**: Errors occurred silently without clear logging
- **Solution**: Added extensive logging with emoji prefixes for easy tracking
  - 🌐 [BROWSER] - Browser lifecycle events
  - 📄 [DISCOVERY] - Discovery phase
  - 👷 [Worker N] - Test execution workers
  - 🧪 [Worker N] - Individual test execution
  - 🧹 [CLEANUP] - Resource cleanup

## Files Modified

1. **`packages/api/src/modules/autonomous-testing/autonomous-testing.controller.ts`**
   - Changed `headless: true` → `headless: false`
   - Reduced `parallelWorkers: 5` → `3`

2. **`packages/test-engine/src/autonomous/AutonomousTestingOrchestrator.ts`**
   - Added browser launch logging
   - Added error handling in browser close
   - Added discovery phase logging
   - Fixed "registration" phase type

3. **`packages/test-engine/src/executor/TestExecutor.ts`**
   - Added `page.isClosed()` checks before operations
   - Improved context/page lifecycle management
   - Added detailed step-by-step logging
   - Better video capture error handling
   - Proper cleanup in finally blocks

## How to Test

### 1. Start the API Server
```powershell
cd D:\Project\TestMaster
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start the Desktop App
```powershell
cd D:\Project\TestMaster
npm run dev:desktop
```

### 3. Run Autonomous Testing
1. Open the desktop app
2. Navigate to Autonomous Testing
3. Enter a website URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
4. Click "Start Testing"
5. **You should now see:**
   - ✅ Browser window appearing
   - ✅ Detailed console logs showing each phase
   - ✅ Tests executing with visible browser actions
   - ✅ No "Target page closed" errors

## Expected Console Output

## Troubleshooting

### If browser still doesn't appear:
1. Check console logs for "🌐 [BROWSER] Headless mode: false"
2. Verify API server is running on correct port
3. Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking Chromium

### If you see "Target page closed" errors:
1. Check the detailed error logs with stack traces
2. Look for specific step that failed
3. Check if website has aggressive anti-bot protection

### If tests are slow or hanging:
1. Reduce parallel workers further (change to 1 or 2)
2. Increase timeouts in test execution
3. Check network connectivity

## Performance Notes

- **Parallel Workers**: Now set to 3 (down from 5)
  - Adjust based on your system: 
    - Low-end: Use 1-2 workers
    - Mid-range: Use 2-3 workers  
    - High-end: Use 3-5 workers

- **Browser Launch**: Timeout increased to 60s
  - First launch may take longer as Playwright initializes

- **Video Recording**: Saved to `./test-results/videos/`
  - Videos are captured even on failures
  - Check video files for visual debugging

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test with a simple website first** (like `https://example.com`)
2. ✅ **Verify browser appears and tests execute**
3. ✅ **Check console logs are detailed and clear**
4. Then try with your target application
5. Adjust parallel workers based on performance
6. Review test results and videos

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] API server running without errors
- [ ] Desktop app connected and authenticated  
- [ ] Browser window appears when testing starts
- [ ] Detailed logs visible in API console
- [ ] Tests execute without "Target closed" errors
- [ ] Video files created in test-results folder
- [ ] Progress updates showing in desktop app

---

**Status**: ✅ **READY TO TEST**

All critical fixes have been applied. The browser should now be visible and tests should execute without premature closure errors.
